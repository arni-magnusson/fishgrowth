Title: Growth from Tags and Otoliths
Authors@R: c(person("Arni", "Magnusson", role=c("aut","cre"), email="thisisarni@gmail.com"),
  person("Mark", "Maunder", role="aut"))
Depends: RTMB
Description: Fit growth models to tagging data and otolith data, using RTMB and
  maximum likelihood. The tagging data provide information about the observed
  length at release and length at recapture at a later time, where the age at
  release is unknown and estimated as a vector of parameters. The otoliths
  provide direct observed coordinates of age and length.
