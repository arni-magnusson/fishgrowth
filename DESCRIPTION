Depends: RTMB
LazyData: yes
Description: Fit growth models to otolith data and/or tagging data, using RTMB
  and maximum likelihood. The tagging data provide information about the
  observed length at release and length at recapture at a later time, where the
  age at release is unknown and estimated as a vector of parameters. The
  otoliths provide direct observed coordinates of age and length.
